    <p>
      My name is Leon Pahole and I come from Maribor, Slovenia. I am 23 years
      old. I study computer science and I currently work as a web focused
      developer. I have working experience in full stack web development, *nix
      system administration, server configuration, devops, cloud and system
      maintenance. In my past time, I do a lot of research to improve my
      existing knowledge, and I also play with machine learning, computer vision
      and blockchain technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am proficient at communication, both with my team and the end user. I
      also consider myself a good menthor and a teacher. I enjoy presenting and
      passing knowledge to an individual or a large group of people, while also
      researching on my own or learning from someone else to improve my
      knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I like to play sports, read books, travel, listen to
      music and learn new things.

  <h1>Education</h1>

  <p>
    My interest in computer science and programming was sparkled in 7th grade of
    elementary school, when I began actively using the computer. This inspired
    me to begin exploring programming in C++ and Java. Because I really enjoyed
    it, I decided to pursue a programming career.
